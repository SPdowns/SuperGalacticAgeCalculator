## Description
This is an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years. Then determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet

## Specifications
This needs to take in a persons age in earth years and convert it to a corresponding planet solar year. I'm thinking just enter in a name and age, and then have an output where all planets are listed in text and print the calculatedage and calculatedlifeexpectency.

**Behavior 1**: This will create a person object with a name and date of birth
  * Input: Name: Sean; DOB: 06/26/2001
  * Output: Person1 = Name: Sean; DOB: 06/26/2001

**Behavior 2**: This wil calculate the age on mercury, A year is 88 days on mercury.
  * Input: Name: Sean; DOB: 06/26/2001
  * Output: Earth Age: 15; Mercury Age: 62

**Behavior 3**: This wil calculate the life expectancy on mercury, Life expexctancy will be 80 for every person.
  * Input: Name: Sean; DOB: 06/26/2001
  * Output: Earth Age: 15; Mercury Age: 62; Life left on earth: 65 years; Life left on mercury; 18 years
